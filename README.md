# 🗺️ Clustering Tourist Reviews for Destination Insights  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **unsupervised learning** to analyze and cluster tourist reviews in order to gain insights into destinations.  
By applying **clustering algorithms** on text data, we can discover hidden patterns, group similar reviews, and understand what tourists value most in their experiences.  

Key objectives:  
- Preprocess and clean tourist review text data.  
- Apply clustering techniques to group similar reviews.  
- Identify common themes and insights from each cluster.  
- Provide actionable knowledge for tourism boards and businesses.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data preprocessing  
- **NLTK / spaCy** → Natural Language Processing (text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)  
- **Scikit-learn** → TF-IDF, clustering (KMeans, etc.), dimensionality reduction  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **WordCloud** → Visual representation of frequent terms  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Analysis & experimentation

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Removing duplicates & null values  
   - Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal  
   - Converting reviews into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**  

2. **Clustering**  
   - KMeans clustering applied on text embeddings  
   - Optimal cluster selection using **Elbow Method** & **Silhouette Score**  
   - Cluster labeling for interpretability  

3. **Insights Extraction**  
   - Word frequency analysis within clusters  
   - Word clouds for visualization  
   - Identifying key tourist preferences and pain points

## 🎯 Why Clustering?  
Clustering is useful because:  
- Tourist reviews are **unstructured text data**.  
- Clustering helps in segmenting reviews into meaningful groups.  
- Provides insights without requiring labeled data.  
- Helps tourism boards and businesses understand customer sentiments and themes.

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Reviews were successfully clustered into distinct groups (e.g., nature-focused, cultural, food-related, service quality).  
- WordClouds highlighted common terms in each cluster.  
- Destination managers can leverage these insights to improve services and marketing strategies.
